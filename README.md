# Qanary Chatbot UI

This simple chatbot like installation is enabled to an easy access to Question Answering (QA) system build using the [Qanary framework](https://github.com/WDAqua/Qanary). You can host your own Web UI or just use our demo installation. Of course, you can connect also to you own Qanary-driven QA system. The Web UI contains an easy-to-use configuration (see the upper right corner) where you can connect instantly to the/your Qanary service and define the components you would like to use.
